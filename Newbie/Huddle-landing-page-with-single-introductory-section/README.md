## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is my Solution For [Huddle landing page with single introductory section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0/hub) There are some technologies that I used while building this challenge.
* HTML
* CSS
* Flex-box
* GSAP
* BEM

## What I learned
* Learned about a new `Meta Tag` which can useful for changing the theme of browser [theme-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color)
* Learned about a new `CSS reset` [Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/)

## My Strategy
* solution build using `Mobile First Workflow Approach`
* More Focus was on `Accessibility`

## Let's take a look of HTML File
well as usual I tried to use the `semantic HTML` for my solution and after seeing the demo image I created three sections for my solutions 

* ### Header Section

  First of all in my `HTML file` i have a `header section` which has the logo of the page

* ### Main Section

  and after that I created a `main section` and inside the `main section` there is two `div` elements 
one for `illustration-mockups image` and second one contain all the other information about the page

* ### Footer Section

  and at the end I have my `footer element` which will contain three `social media icons`
  
* Other than that I created a `sr-only` class for the `<h1> tag` 
* and also added a `fevicon image`
* and writed a wonderful `title` for the page 
* and learned about a new `meta tag` that I alredy mentioned above
* also I had a thought about to use `_blank` with the social media links icon but didn't added because this is a small challenge and don't wanted to complex it
  
## CSS
* explored some new `css reset`
* used `Mobile First Workflow Approach`
* made responsive using `media queries`
* used three types of screen sizes
  `custom`, `700px`, `1250px`
