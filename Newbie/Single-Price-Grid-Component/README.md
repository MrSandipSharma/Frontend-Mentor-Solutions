# Single Price Grid Component

this is my solution for `Single Price Grid Component`  and in this solution I also added a starting animation using `Gsap`
* used `Prettier` Code Formatter to Format the Code
* Solution Build using `Mobile First Workflow` Approach

## [Live Demo](https://frontend-mentor-solutions-by-ss.netlify.app/newbie/single-price-grid-component/)

## [Page Index Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-frontend-mentor-solutions-by-ss-netlify-app-newbie-single-price-grid-component/goz22ptyvv?form_factor=mobile)

at this point I don't have an idea about `how to write a proper README.md file` but I wanted to write something about my solution and if anyone have some suggestions about `how to write a README.md file` please help me.

## Let's take a look of HTML file

* At the beginning of the project I had an idea about using an `article tag` but was not sure about it.
* used a sr-only class for `<h1> tag`
* used `BEM` naming conventions to write class name.
* used a unordered list for `Why us` container.

## CSS 

* for layout it is the best time to use `flexbox` but I used `Grid` because I wanted to practice `Grid`
* used Colors according to `style-guide.md`

## Animation

* for `Animation` I used `Gsap`
* for spliting text I used `split-type library` you can check the library [here](https://npm.io/package/split-type)

## Accessibility Issue

* Got a lot of `Color Contrast Issues`

## What's Next

* wanted to write more `readable code`
* wants to handle `color contrast issue`
* and for `accessibility` wants to find a way their user can choose he wants `animation` or not.

*Thanks for reading my `README.md` 
I'm waiting for your Valuable Feedback*
