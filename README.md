[Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)

## Welcome üëè

Well, This repository belongs to all the solutions that I created for `Frontend Mentor Challenges` and actually they are fun challenges and you also can learn a lot from the `frontend mentor community`
  
## What is Frontend Mentor challenges
Frontend Mentor is a place for all the `frontend developers` who wants to practice their frontend skills It is a great place for them. `Frontend mentor` provide a lot of challenges in different categories and that will definetly going to challenge your skills in every aspect 

Currently Frontend mentor challenges are in five categories :
* Newbie
* Junior
* Intermediate
* Advanced
* Guru

and also they have some `premium challenges` but I don't have that much money to buy them that's why I am just completing all the challenges that are available for free

## why I have only one repository for all the challenges ?
Actually I feel it's easy to manage all the solutions in one place like you don't need to create a lot different repository for diffrent challenges rather than that you can upload all the challenges in one place and they all challenges are similar so that's why I decided to create a single repository for all the frontend mentor solutions.


## How I found out Front End Mentor ?
Well all thanks to google, actually their is an interesting story behind that I was really frustrated about my life and I was just unable to find a way where I can practice my skills or my knowledge about Frontend I just googled `where we can practice our Frontend skills` and I got a ton of different results and different sites but some sites are paid and for some sites I was not that skilled that time and then I found Frontend mentor Its just was a savior for me

## What are the tools and skills that I used for these challenges ?
  I am using a lot of tools like :
  * VS Code : My Code Editor
  * Firefox : My Favarit browser
  * Prettier : Code Formatter
  * Axe : To find Accessibility issues
  * Lighthouse : another tool that helps to find accessibility issues
  * Googles page speed index: for speed test
  * pixel-perfect pro : to get the dimensions of design

  and there are some technologies that I am using :
  * semantic-html
  * CSS-3
  * JavaScript-6
  * gsap : for animation
  * BEM : Block Element Modifier

and I continuously working on learning new things.

`I am not perfect yet but I am on the path to becoming pro developer.`

I have a believe on the thought that
`Explore more learn more`
